                <p>Accepting all cookies means you're allowing a website to store various types of cookies on your device. This includes cookies necessary for the website's basic functions, as well as others used for analytics, advertising, and tracking your behavior across the web. By accepting, you agree to both the convenience features, like saving your login details, and to being tracked for personalized ads and content, potentially affecting your privacy.</p>

                <p>Rejecting all cookies, or getting as close as possible by rejecting all but essential ones, means you only allow the website to store cookies that are necessary for its basic functions, like maintaining your session or shopping cart. This limits the website's ability to personalize your experience, perform analytics, or track your behavior for advertising purposes. If there's no option to reject all, choosing the strictest privacy settings minimizes data collection and tracking, protecting your privacy but potentially limiting some site functionalities.</p>
